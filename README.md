# ElasticSearch examples
I've lined up a bunch of examples to showcase the features and the sheer power of [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch). A lot of the information is based on ["ElasticSearch, The Definitive Guide"](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html)

## Installing
Installing ElasticSearch is quite simple, go to [the installation page of the ElasticSearch guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/running-elasticsearch.html).

Install both ElasticSearch & the Sense plugin for Kibana.
